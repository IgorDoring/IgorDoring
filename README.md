Hi!

I'm Igor Doring, from Brazil, I enjoyed computers for a really good part of my life. 
Not gonna lie, started with videogames, but i learned coding in high school.

Since then, i knew that i should work with computers, thats why i have a certificate on informatics from a small school in a small city. 
I tried everything from maintenance to programming, what i've liked best was web development, but that does not mean that i don't know a little bit of everything.

This is only a introduction, but i'll try to prove my knowledge on this Hub!
